# Movie-Data-P3

4th March: Before starting work on this project, I thought it would be wise to learn a but more basic JS. My main resource for this was code academy. I started learning the different kinds of variables and their various uses. I also learnt about medthods and string interpolation.
By the end of the day I finished the built-in projects regardin all of the above. I had some difficulty remembering the format of the code and also training my brain to think in a very linearly logic way.
5th March: Today I re-evulated my progress from yesterday and began studying more about If, Then and Else statements.
6th March: I copied the JS code from the coders and founders website and intend to make a tangible start to my movie data page.
My first goal is to implement my design ideas using html and CSS. Once I have done this, I will move on to the javascript.
7th: March: Today I decided to start work on the HTML and CSS elements of my movie data. At this point my plan was to make a visually appealing page with interacting cards that show each of the five movies.
I spent a lot of time styling and formatting. I wanted the cards to be centered so I had do do a lot if trial and error with flex.
Now that I have done this, I have decided how I am going to implement JS funcitonality to my project. I am going to make a small table below the decorations that I have designed today. I don't yet know how to create and format a table, so some online research is what I am doing.
8th March: LEARNT TO MAKE TABLE. I went online and found a way to create the basic contents and structure of a table.
To do this I had to us <tr> , <th> and <td> tags. <Tr> is the main tag that wraps my other tags and content, <th> stands for "table head" and refers the to the info at the top of the table. In other words: the catergories section. Finally, <td> is the information INSIDE the table itself. I organized the tags in a coherent way and populated it with all of the movie data provided in the JS by Founders and coders.
The end result is very rough and clearly needs more work and styling to look like a proper table. I also will then need to add JS features like "search by" and the ability ot add a movie to the table.
