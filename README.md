# Movie-Data-P3

4th March: Before starting work on this project, I thought it would be wise to learn a but more basic JS. My main resource for this was code academy. I started learning the different kinds of variables and their various uses. I also learnt about medthods and string interpolation.
By the end of the day I finished the built-in projects regardin all of the above. I had some difficulty remembering the format of the code and also training my brain to think in a very linearly logic way.
5th March: Today I re-evulated my progress from yesterday and began studying more about If, Then and Else statements.
6th March: I copied the JS code from the coders and founders website and intend to make a tangible start to my movie data page.
My first goal is to implement my design ideas using html and CSS. Once I have done this, I will move on to the javascript.
