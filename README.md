# Movie-Data-P3

4th March: Before starting work on this project, I thought it would be wise to learn a but more basic JS. My main resource for this was code academy. I started learning the different kinds of variables and their various uses. I also learnt about medthods and string interpolation.
By the end of the day I finished the built-in projects regardin all of the above. I had some difficulty remembering the format of the code and also training my brain to think in a very linearly logic way.
5th March: Today I re-evulated my progress from yesterday and began studying more about If, Then and Else statements.
6th March: I copied the JS code from the coders and founders website and intend to make a tangible start to my movie data page.
My first goal is to implement my design ideas using html and CSS. Once I have done this, I will move on to the javascript.
7th: March: Today I decided to start work on the HTML and CSS elements of my movie data. At this point my plan was to make a visually appealing page with interacting cards that show each of the five movies.
I spent a lot of time styling and formatting. I wanted the cards to be centered so I had do do a lot if trial and error with flex.
Now that I have done this, I have decided how I am going to implement JS funcitonality to my project. I am going to make a small table below the decorations that I have designed today. I don't yet know how to create and format a table, so some online research is what I am doing.
